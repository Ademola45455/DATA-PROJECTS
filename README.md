  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  

  EDA involved exploring the database to answer key questions, such as:
  - What is the total employees in the company?
  - Top highest paid employees?
  - Average salary of the employees?
  - Employees who earned more than a particular amount?
 
### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code worked with

``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM employeess
WHERE salary > 50000;
```
``` SQL
SELECT
	employee_id,
	first_name,
	last_name,
	salary
FROM employeess
WHERE salary BETWEEN 35000 AND 50000;
```

``` SQL
SELECT 
	email,
	COALESCE(email, 'NO EMAIL PROVIDED')
FROM employeess;
```

### Summary
This project showcases my ability to design, manage, and analyze employee data using SQL. It demonstrates essential skills in database management, query optimization, and data analysis, resulting in actionable insights that support business decisions and HR strategies.
